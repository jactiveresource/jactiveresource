jactiveresource
---------------

Ruby on Rails includes ActiveResource, a module for for consuming services provided by other Rails applications. jactiveresource helps you easily consume these same services in your Java based applications.

Ryan Daigle says: “ActiveResource provides a large piece of the REST puzzle by basically implementing the client side of a RESTful system – the parts of a decoupled system that consume RESTful services. At its essence, ActiveResource provides a way to utilize model objects as REST-based client proxies to remote services.”

jactiveresource creates Java objects from RESTful services quickly and easily.  Give it a URL, and you get POJO's (no hash maps) with automatic type conversions.  When talking to Rails resources, jactiveresource includes specializations that make Java as DRY as it can get.
