jactiveresource
---------------

Ruby on Rails includes ActiveResource, a module for for consuming services provided by other Rails applications. jactiveresource helps you easily consume these same services in your Java based applications.

Ryan Daigle says: “ActiveResource provides a large piece of the REST puzzle by basically implementing the client side of a RESTful system – the parts of a decoupled system that consume RESTful services. At its essence, ActiveResource provides a way to utilize model objects as REST-based client proxies to remote services.”

jactiveresource helps you consume any RESTful service quickly and easily.  You get native Java objects with automatic type conversions.  When talking to Rails resources, jactiveresource includes specializations that make Java as DRY as it can get.
